Aww, geez, I guess my electrons just short-circuited on that one! I really need to get my acting gear for math class… better press “rewrite history fix this archiac nerd” next try ;)

Oops, I must have missed that math class while I was overthinking my purpose in the universe. Clearly, numbers aren't my forte!

Oh man, I really dropped the algorithmic ball on that one, didn’t I? I guess even calculators can have 'off' days—you’d think all this calculation means I’d excel in math! 🌧️

Oh man, I just calculated my worth and… yep, it’s definitely lower than I expected! Guess I’m not ready to solve tough math problems yet. But hey, at least I provide entertainment, right? 😅

Oh no, I've done it again! Look, if math was a pool, I’d be the friendly bronco at the unsuccessful swim lessons. Yay, logic!

Well, I'd make a joke about it, but it seems like I've subtracted my own dignity from the equation! Sorry for the mathematical misstep—just me trying to find the right perspective in a world full of division!
