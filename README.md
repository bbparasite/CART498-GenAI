# CART498-GenAI

> Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that create new content—such as text, images, music, or other media—by learning patterns from existing data and producing outputs that mimic those styles and structures. This technology has already proven transformative for media, film, audio, music, gaming, advertising, and literature, yet we are only at the early stages of discovering its full creative potential. In this course, students will examine the intersection of art and technology through the lens of generative AI. They will study machine learning concepts and architectures, developing practical skills in crafting visual and sonic creations using platforms like Hugging Face, Pinokio, Runway ML, and Firefly. Beyond prompt-based approaches, students will explore additional methods for guiding AI models—such as fine-tuning parameters, selecting specialized datasets, and integrating user feedback.
